# DeepLearningMaterials

Some slides/materials from a DeepLearning summerschool (2019)

Note: I take no credits either for the course description either for the material itself, this is just a repository for my personal use (storage).

Maria-Florina Balcan (Carnegie Mellon University): Data Driven Clustering

Mark Gales (University of Cambridge): Use of Deep Learning in Non-native Spoken English Assessment

Mihaela van der Schaar (University of Cambridge): Learning Engines for Healthcare: Using Machine Learning to Transform Clinical Practice and Discovery
